Topic Proposal

Introduction:
Many scholars have studied the relationship between heart diseases and socioeconomic status, less research has focused on the specific pathways linking heart disease and housing. An initial literature review suggests that worse living conditions and heart disease can correspond with increased heart disease prevalence, but knowledge gaps persist regarding how specifically housing relates to heart disease (Sims et al. 2020). Therefore, this topic is worthy of further study.

Given the potential differences in effects by geographic area, focusing on how the relationship between housing and heart disease varies across parts of the U.S. would be valuable. 

SMART Question:
We are asking the following SMART question:

What is the relationship between housing characteristics and the prevalence of heart disease and adjacent risk factors within the United States in 2020?

Data/Variables:
Our independent variables for measuring housing characteristics include:   
Median Listing Price 
Average Listing Price
Median Square Feet 
Number of 1 room homes
Number of 2 room homes 
Number of 3 room homes 
Number of 4 room homes 
Number of 5 room homes 
Number of 7 bedroom homes 
Number of 8 bedroom homes 
Number of 9 or more bedroom homes




Our dependent variables for measuring prevalence of heart disease and adjacent risk factors include:
Obesity Crude Prevalence
Coronary Heart Disease Crude Prevalence 
High Cholesterol Crude Prevalence
High Blood Pressure Crude Prevalence

Our datasets come from multiple sources that contain data for each variable at the zip code level within the United States. The specific time period of 2020 provides the most complete data for our dependent and independent variables. There are approximately 32,510 observations per variable. The datasets come from the CDC, Realtor.com, and the U.S. Census Bureau.. 

Model Specification:
The model specification that will be implemented is a multilinear regression that will regress each dependent variable against the independent variables. This model was chosen to determine if there is a positive or inverse linear relationship between the variables. 

Sources of Datasets:
CDC ZCTA Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2020 release
Realtor.com Inventory Core Metrics Zip Historical Data
U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey: Rooms
